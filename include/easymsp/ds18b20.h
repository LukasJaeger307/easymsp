/**
 * \page ds18b20 Interfacing a DS18B20-thermometer with MSP430
 * Maxim's DS18B20-thermometers are to be accessed with Maxim's own
 * OneWire-protocol. Unlike SPI or I2C it is not supported natively
 * by an MSP430 so the protocol is emulated. I don't wanna bore you
 * with details on the protocol and if you want to use your DS18B20
 * you just need to connect your thermometer with your LaunchPad and
 * call a single function to get the temperature in degrees celsius.
 * If you want any other unit, convert it yourself or even better
 * get used to the metric system.
 * Connect the _VDD_-line of the DS18B20 with the _VDD_-line of your
 * LaunchPad. Do the same with the _GND_ line and connect the data wire
 * with a free digital pin of your LaunchPad. Insert a resistor of
 * about 5 Kiloohms between _VDD_ and the data line. Now add the 
 * temperature measuring code to your software. Make sure, your MSP
 * runs with a clock frequency of 1MHz. Otherwise you need to change
 * the parameters of all _delay_cycle_-functions. Let's assume you chose
 * pin 1.4 for your data wire. Measure the temperature with
 * 
 * ```c
 * float temperature;
 * ds_get_temperature(1, 4, &temperature);
 * ```
 *
 * Printing it is a little difficult since there is no _itoa_ on an
 * MSP430. I did it that way:
 *
 * ```c
 * char string [6];
 * sprintf(string, "%u.%02u", (int) temperature, (int) ((temperature - (float)((int)(temperature))) * 100));
 * uart_tx_string("Temperature: ");
 * uart_tx_string(string);
 * uart_tx_string("\r\n");
 * ```
 * 
 * which is admittedly not elegant but works fine.
