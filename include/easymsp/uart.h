  * \page uart The UART-header
  * A header that provides some helpful functions to setup the UART-interface
  * on your MSP430. Set your UART-jumpers to hardware UART before usage. You can
  * setup the interface with 9600 baud using \ref uart_setup. After you have done
  * that you can transmit single chars using \ref uart_tx and whole strings
  * (null-terminated please) with \ref uart_tx_string. It's as easy as this:
  * ```c
  * uart_setup();
  * uart_tx_string("Hello world\r\n");
  * ```
